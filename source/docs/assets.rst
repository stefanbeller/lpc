Castle
======

*Note: we love these castle tiles, but note that they're a bit
trickier to view as examples... some of them look like they have
perspective lines, but that's actually a reflection of more complex
geometry in the building.  In general, it's better and easier to stick
to simpler geometry that won't give this kind of illusion.*
